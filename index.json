Emphasis all mine.\n The Hindu sacred writings profess to teach, not only all that it is needful to know about religion, but about science, philosophy, and history, as well. Geography and astronomy are supposed as really to be subjects of inspired authoritative teaching as theology. Their instructions, especially in all branches of natural science, are as fabulous and imaginary as they well can be. It necessarily happens, therefore, that a knowledge of European science explodes all belief in popular Hinduism. This result is brought about by the purely secular education given in Government colleges, and, to a less extent, by the education given in common vernacular schools; but since the missionary institutions in which a superior education is given in English, combine the advantages of these, with others especially their own, a brief allusion to them is becoming.\nThey are not needed for the people generally. A plain education in their own mother tongue is best fitted for them, and missionary institutions are too expensive to be established everywhere ; but in the large towns, where an English education is a necessity, a great gain, and a desirable accomplishment, to large numbers of the wealthy and high caste, it is of the highest importance that they should exist. More than a fourth of the pupils in these institutions are Brahmins, and more than another fourth are Kaisths, one of the most influential caste divisions ; indeed they contain very few but such as belong to families influential by caste, or respectable in our sense of the term. It is obvious, that to bring such under a highly literary and Christian course of instruction, is of the highest importance.\nTo diffuse Christianity is of course the special design of such institutions. The literary and scientific instruction given, is made subservient to this great end. To obtain the latter is the only reason why Hindus send their sons to such places ; they had much rather have the purely secular without the religious instruction, but this missionaries could not give. They require as a matter of course, that students shall read the Scriptures and books on the evidences of Christianity, as well as attend to general instruction. Nor do they find any reluctance to comply with these conditions. The Hindu submits, as he always does when firmly and sensibly dealt with. This, then, is the tacit agreement existing between the two parties : — the Hindu comes to us and submits to receive our Christian education, that he may obtain a good and cheap secular training ; we give him the latter, that we may get him to accept of the former.\nThe effects of this form of education have been briefly alluded to ; they may well, however, be more definitely stated:—\n  In almost all cases, when the students remain even a moderate time, there is the annihilation in their minds of some of the greatest obstacles to the evangelization of the people. All belief in the existence of gods and goddesses, all confidence in the Shastras, all reverence for caste, are destroyed : the whole system comes to be regarded with contempt, derision, and dislike. Various reasons may lead to outward conformity with the requirements of Hinduism; but all faith in them is swept away. Among those who reach the upper classes in these institutions, there is not one in thirty who leaves with any convictions that the popular religion is either good or true.\n  The moral tone and character of all who receive the education described is elevated and corrected; they are more honest, truthful, temperate, and manly than the heathen around them, and they as certainly excel the students of the Government colleges. It is often, indeed, very interesting to watch how far they are under the unconscious power of Christianity. Their modes of reasoning on moral questions are mainly Christian, even when they deny the divinity of our faith. This, of course, is the natural result of a system of training based avowedly on the Scriptures, and it is one which, though not saving in its effects, has a value we can hardly over-estimate.\n  Though this form of education is eminently preparatory to the general diffusion of Christianity, it has also been the means of a large number of conversions. The Free Church mission in Calcutta had, from 1830 to 1855, seventy males admitted into the Church by baptism ; twenty-two of these were Brahmins. Nearly all these were the fruits of English education. Of the twenty-nine baptized as the result of instruction given in the London Missionary Society\u0026rsquo;s Institution, Calcutta, between 1850 and 1857, six were Kulin Brahmins, and most of the others were of high caste. Besides those actually baptized, a still larger number have avowed their belief in the divine origin of Christianity, but have been prevented from embracing it by the entreaties and machinations of friends, or by reluctance to face the enormous difficulties attendant on a profession of Christianity.\n  The higher Christian character of such converts, and their greater usefulness, are not to be overlooked. Their conversion is usually a kind of link between Christians and one or more influential families, who frequently learn more of Christianity than others, by having baptized relatives. Such conversions are usually beyond suspicion, and, whilst they deepen respect for our faith, they suggest inquiry as to the source of its power. It may truly be added that they constitute the most consistent and intelligent portion of the native Church. Nor must their usefulness as preachers and teachers be forgotten. At the last date alluded to, when referring to the Calcutta Free Church Mission, there were belonging to it three ordained native ministers ; four applicants to be licensed for preaching ; two probationary catechists ; several applicants for being taken on trial for that office ; and four efficient teachers. Out of the converts just mentioned, belonging to the London Missionary Society\u0026rsquo;s Institution, two are catechists ; one was obliged to relinquish missionary work through ill health; two are headteachers in missionary schools ; several are disposed to engage in missionary labors, and some probably will do so.\n   ","permalink":"http://nepalkura.github.io/posts/the-effects-of-anglo-indian-education/","summary":"Book - India and Christian Missions Author - Rev.
